# Rowing-machine
Programed microcontroller (KL25Z) for sensory input and android application for GUI as well as the interface between them (UART and Bluetooth) to log the usersâ€™ physical activity in real time.
Me main role was to program the machine completly in C. I was in charge of the sensory systema the machine had to mesure the amount of distance was traveled by the user. To do this a Hall effect sensor was used and by making the microcontroller have hardaware and software interrupts; the objective was met. My other role was to create the android app with an integrated data base (google's firebase) so the user could operate the machine and have a record of his progress.
